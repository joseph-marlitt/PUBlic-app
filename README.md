# PUBlic
**PUBlic** is an application for beer connoisseurs. It allows users to sign in with Facebook, and reveals breweries in their current area.  Users can plan routes, and get detailed information on breweries of their choice by using the search feature.  Performing a search will override the map markers showing nearby breweries, and instead show map markers generated from their search.  

Users can also explore beers on the **_beer search_** page.  This page allows you to search for beer names and displays relevant data for that beer.  Each result can be favorited, which saves it to their beers' database. They can then visit the favorites page to view data on all their favorites beers and keep track of which ones they want to try next!

This app is useful for anyone wanting to explorer beers or breweries available in certain areas, find out about other beers made by their favorite brewery, or just get some interesting info on their favorite beers.
